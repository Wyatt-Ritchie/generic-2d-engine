# generic_2d_engine
This is a barebone generic 2d engine that I am working on. Much of the architecture is based
on the examples provided in Game Programming in C++ by Sanjay Madhav. 

It uses SDL2 for the handling of sprites, textures, and UI components.

The audio system uses FMOD for sound events and music.
